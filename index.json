What is the pressure of the gas if the volume is doubled?\nThere are two ways we could use the Ideal Gas Law to solve this problem:\nWe could solve for \\(n = \\frac{PV}{RT}\\) and then use that to solve for \\(P_2 = \\frac{nRT}{V_2}\\) We could notice that the right side of the equation, \\(nRT\\) is a constant, since no moles of gas can escape, R is a constant by definition, and the temperature is not changed in the question. Since the right side is a constant, the left side must remain a constant. If the volume is doubled, then the pressure must thus be halved.
