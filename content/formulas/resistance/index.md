{{< katex >}}

The formula for resistance in a straight conductor (e.g. a wire) is:

$$ R = \frac{\rho l}{A} $$

Where

* \\(\small R \\) is the resistance,
* \\(\small \rho \\) is the resistivity of the material,
* \\(\small l \\) is the length of the conductor, and
* \\(\small A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the conductor.
