The hydraulic diameter is a characteristic length scale for fluid flow in non-circular pipes. It replaces the diameter of a circular pipe with an equivalent diameter based on the cross-sectional area and wetted perimeter of the non-circular pipe. It is defined as:

$$ D_h = \frac{4A_c}{P} $$

Where:

- \\(D_h\\) is the hydraulic diameter,
- \\(A_c\\) is the cross-sectional area of the flow, and
- \\(P\\) is the wetted perimeter of the cross-section.
