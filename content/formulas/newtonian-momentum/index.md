$$p = mv$$

Where
* \\(p\\) is the momentum of the body,
* \\(m\\) is the mass of the body, and
* \\(v\\) is the velocity of the body

This formula relates the momentum of a body to its mass and velocity.

## Example
Kevin throws a baseball with a mass of 0.5 kg at a speed of 5000000 m/s. What is the momentum of the baseball?

We know that momentum is equal to mass times velocity, so we can plug in the values to get the answer.

$$p = mv \Longrightarrow p = 0.5 \cdot 5000000 \Longrightarrow p = 2500000 \frac{kg \cdot m}{s}$$
