$$PV = nRT$$

Where
\\(P\\) is the pressure of the gas,
\\(V\\) is the volume of the gas,
\\(n\\) is the number of moles of gas,
\\(R\\) is the gas constant, and
\\(T\\) is the temperature of the gas.

"The ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation, is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations." - Wikipedia
