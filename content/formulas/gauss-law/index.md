$$ \oiint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} $$

Where

* The left side is a surface integral of the electric field \\(\vec{E}\\) over a closed surface \\(\vec{A}\\), and
* \\(Q_{enc}\\) is the charge enclosed by the surface, and
* \\(\epsilon_0\\) is the [permittivity of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity).

## Differential form

Gauss's law can also be written in differential form:

$$ \nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$

Where

* The left side is the [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence) of the electric field \\(\vec{E}\\), and
* \\(\rho\\) is the [charge density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_density).
