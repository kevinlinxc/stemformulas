## Voltage 
The instantaneous voltage across an inductor is given by:

$$ V_L(t) = L \frac{di(t)}{dt} $$

Where

- \\( \small V_L \\) represents the voltage across the inductor.
- \\( \small L \\) is the inductance of the inductor, usually measured in henries (H).
- \\( \small \frac{dI}{dt} \\) is the rate of change of current through the inductor with respect to time.

## Energy
The energy stored in an inductor is given by:

$$ E_L = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 $$

Where

- \\( \small E_L \\) represents the energy stored in the inductor.
- \\( \small L \\) is the inductance of the inductor.
- \\( \small I \\) is the current through the inductor.
