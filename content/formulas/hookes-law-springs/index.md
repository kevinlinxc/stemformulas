{{< katex >}}
$$ F = -kx $$

Where
* \\(F\\) is the force applied to stretch or compress the spring,
* \\(k\\) is the spring constant of the spring, and
* \\(x\\) is the displacement of the spring.

The negative sign is used when the force being considered is the "restoring force". 
If the force is the "applied force", then the negative sign is omitted.
