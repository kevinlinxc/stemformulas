## Finite Geometric Series
For a series of the form \\( \small a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \ldots\\), the sum of the first \\(\small n\\) terms is

$$S_n = \sum_{n=0}^{N} ar^n = \frac{a(1-r^N)}{1-r}$$

where \\(\small r \neq 1 \\) is the common ratio. 

If \\(\small r = 1\\), then \\(\small S_n = aN\\).

## Infinite Geometric Series
If the magnitude of \\(\small r\\) is less than \\(\small 1\\), the sum of the infinite series is

$$S_{\infty} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n = \frac{a}{1-r}$$
