The instantaneous voltage across an inductor is given by:

$$ V = L \frac{dI}{dt} $$

Where

- \\( \small V \\) represents the voltage across the inductor.
- \\( \small L \\) is the inductance of the inductor, usually measured in henries (H).
- \\( \small \frac{dI}{dt} \\) is the rate of change of current through the inductor with respect to time.
