If S is an oriented smooth surface that is bounded by a simple, closed, smooth boundary curve C with positive orientation. and F is a vector field then, Stokes' theorem says that

$$ \int_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \iint_S \nabla \times \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S} $$

Definitely read [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calcIII/stokestheorem.aspx), they're great.

Stokes' theorem can be thought of as a 3D generalization of [Green's theorem](formulas/greens-theorem).
