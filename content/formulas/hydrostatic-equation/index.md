The hydrostatic pressure in a system is the pressure exerted by a fluid at equilibrium due to the force of gravity. The following equations are used to describe the hydrostatic pressure force:

$$ \frac{dP}{dz} = - \rho g $$

$$ P = P_0 - \rho g z $$

$$ \Delta P = \rho g \Delta z $$

Where

* \\( \small P \\) is the pressure,
* \\( \small P_0 \\) is the pressure at some reference point,
* \\( \small z \\) is the height above the reference point,
* \\( \small  \small \rho  \\) is the density of the fluid, and
* \\( \small  \small g  \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.

Note that the negative sign means that the pressure decreases with increasing height.
