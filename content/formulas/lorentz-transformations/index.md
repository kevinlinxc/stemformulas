For a fixed frame of reference \\(\small x, y, z, t\\), the following transformations can be used to transform to a frame of reference moving with velocity \\(\small v\\) with respect to the fixed frame:

$$\small x' = \frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$$
$$ \small y' = y$$
$$ \small z' = z$$
$$ \small t' = \frac{t-vx/c^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$$

Where 
* \\(c\\) is the speed of light
