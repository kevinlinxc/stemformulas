## Euler's Identity
$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$

Where
* \\(e\\) is [Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) ~= 2.71828,
* \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, \\(\sqrt{-1}\\), and
* \\(\pi\\) is [pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) ~= 3.14159.

## Euler's Formula
More generally, for any number (even complex) \\(x\\), Euler's Formula says that

$$e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$$
