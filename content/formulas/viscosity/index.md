The formula relating viscosity and shear deformation rate in a fluid, also known as Newton's law of viscosity is given by the following equation:

$$ \tau = \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} $$

Where

* \\( \small \tau\ \\) is the applied shear stress,
* \\( \small \mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity, with units of pressure \\( \cdot \\) time,
* \\( \small \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\) is shear deformation rate, and
* \\( \small y \\) is the perpendicular distance from the surface.

In the case where velocity varies linearly with y, the equation simplifies to:

$$ \tau = \mu \frac{u}{y} $$
