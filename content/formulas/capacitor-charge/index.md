{{< katex >}}

The relationship between the voltage across a capacitor and the charge stored on each conductor is given by:

$$ V = \frac{Q}{C} $$

Where

- \\( \small V \\) represents the voltage across the capacitor,
- \\( \small Q \\) represents the charge stored on the capacitor, and
- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor, usually measured in farads (F).
