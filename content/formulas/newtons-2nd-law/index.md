$$F = ma$$

Where
\\(F\\) is the net force being applied to the object,
\\(m\\) is the mass of the object, and
\\(a\\) is the acceleration of the object.

Newton's second law is a statement of Newtonian mechanics that the net force on a body is equal to the body's mass times its acceleration.

## Example
Kevin pushes a 10 kg box across the floor with a force of 100 N. Friction pushes back against the box statically
with 10 N of force. What is the acceleration of the box?

$$ F = ma \Longrightarrow a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{100N - 10N}{10kg} = 9.8 m/s^2 $$
