The modulus of toughness is given by:

$$ U_t = \int_{0}^{\epsilon_f}\sigma\mathop{d\epsilon} $$

Where

* \\( \small U_t \\) is the modulus of toughness,
* \\( \small \sigma \\) is the stress,
* \\( \small \epsilon \\) is the strain, and
* \\( \small \epsilon_f \\) is the strain at fracture.

Note that this is the area under the stress-strain curve up to the failure/fracture strain. See the sources for some geometric approximations for the modulus of toughness.
