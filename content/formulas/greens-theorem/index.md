If \\(\small P\\) and \\(\small Q\\) are continuous functions of \\(\small x\\) and \\(\small y\\) over the region \\(\small D\\) with a closed path \\(\small C\\) that bounds \\(\small D\\), then Green's theorem states that

$$ \oint_C Pdx + Qdy = \iint_D \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} dA $$

Honestly, just read [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calcIII/GreensTheorem.aspx), they're great.

Green's theorem can be thought of as a 2D version of [Stokes' theorem](formulas/stokes-theorem).
