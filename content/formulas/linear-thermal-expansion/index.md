{{< katex >}}

The thermal expansion formula is:

$$ \Delta L = L_0 \alpha \Delta T $$

Where

* \\(\small \Delta L\\) is the change in length,
* \\(\small L_0\\) is the initial length,
* \\(\small \alpha\\) is the coefficient of linear expansion, and
* \\(\small \Delta T\\) is the change in temperature in Kelvin.
