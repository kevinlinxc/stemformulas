The Impulse-Momentum Theorem denotes the relationship between the change in momentum and a force that is applied over a time interval. It is given by:

$$ J = \Delta p = F \Delta t $$

Where

* \\( \small \small J \\) is the impulse,
* \\( \small \small \Delta p \\) is the change in momentum (which is how impulse is defined),
* \\( \small \small F \\) is the net applied force, and
* \\( \small \small \Delta t \\) is the time interval over which the force is applied.
