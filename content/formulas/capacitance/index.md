The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by:

$$ C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} $$

Where

- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor, measured in farads (F),
- \\( \small \epsilon \\) is the permittivity of the dielectric between the plates, in farads per meter (F/m),
- \\( \small A \\) is the area of the plates in square meters (m<sup>2</sup>), and
- \\( \small d \\) is the distance between the plates in meters.
