$$V = IR$$

Where
\\(V\\) is the voltage across the conductor (e.g. a wire),
\\(I\\) is the current through the conductor, and
\\(R\\) is the resistance of the conductor.

Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. - Wikipedia

## Example

Kevin measures the voltage across a 10 ohm resistor to be 5 volts. What is the current through the resistor?

$$ V = IR \Longrightarrow I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{5V}{10\Omega} = 0.5 A $$
