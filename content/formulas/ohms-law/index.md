Ohm's law is given by:

$$V = IR$$

Where
\\(V\\) is the voltage across the conductor (e.g. a wire),
\\(I\\) is the current through the conductor, and
\\(R\\) is the resistance of the conductor.

Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. - Wikipedia

## Example

Kevin measures the current through a 10 ohm resistor to be 0.5 A. He measures the current with the resistor actually connected to the circuit (sorry Mr. Sidney). What is the voltage across the resistor?

$$ V = IR \Longrightarrow V = 10 * 0.5 = 5V $$
