The formula for the period of a simple pendulum is:

$$ T_p = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{\ell}{g}} $$

Where

* \\(\small T_p\\) is the period of oscillation,
* \\(\small \ell\\) is the length of the pendulum, and
* \\(\small g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.

The frequency of oscillation is the reciprocal of the period:

$$ f_p = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{g}{\ell}} $$

Where

* \\(\small f_p\\) is the frequency of oscillation.

**Note:** These formulas use an approximation that assume small oscillations (small angles) and neglects air resistance, damping, and the mass of the string.
