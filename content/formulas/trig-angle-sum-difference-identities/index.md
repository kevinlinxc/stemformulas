For arbitrary angles \\(\small a\\) and \\(\small b\\), the following are true:

$$ sin(a + b) = sin(a) cos(b) + cos(a) sin(b) $$
$$ sin(a - b) = sin(a) cos(b) - cos(a) sin(b) $$

$$ cos(a + b) = cos(a) cos(b) - sin(a) sin(b) $$
$$ cos(a - b) = cos(a) cos(b) + sin(a) sin(b) $$

$$ tan(a + b) = \frac{tan(a) + tan(b)}{1 - tan(a) tan(b)} $$
$$ tan(a - b) = \frac{tan(a) - tan(b)}{1 + tan(a) tan(b)} $$
