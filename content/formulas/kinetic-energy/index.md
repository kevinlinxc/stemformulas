$$ E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

Where
* \\(E_k\\) is the kinetic energy of the object,
* \\(m\\) is the mass of the object, and
* \\(v\\) is the velocity of the object.

## Example
Kevin throws a 400,000 kg spaceship off of an infinity tall cliff. After some time, it reaches a terminal velocity of 500 m/s. What is the kinetic energy of the spaceship at this point?

We know that kinetic energy is equal to \\(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), so we can plug in the values to get the answer:

$$ \scriptsize E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \Longrightarrow E_k = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 400000 \cdot 500^2 \Longrightarrow E_k = 5.0 \cdot 10^{10} J $$
