The conditional probability formula is:

$$ P(E|F) = \frac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)} $$

Where

* \\(\small P(E|F)\\) is the probability of event \\(E\\) given event \\(F\\),
* \\(\small P(E \cap F)\\) (the intersection of the two events) is the probability of both events \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) occurring, and
* \\(\small P(F)\\) is the probability of event \\(F\\).
