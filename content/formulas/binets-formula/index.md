Binet's formula allows you to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, \\( \small F_n \\), with a closed form solution. It is as follows:

$$ F_n = \frac{\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^n - \left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^n}{\sqrt{5}} $$

Where

* \\( \small n \\) is the index of the Fibonacci number you want to calculate.
