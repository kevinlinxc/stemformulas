The Heisenberg picture (also known as the Heisenberg representation) is a fundamental time-dependent differential equation in quantum mechanics. In the Heisenberg picture, the state vectors remain fixed, and the operators evolve over time. The general form of the equation is:

$$ {d \over d t}A_H = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[A_H, H] + \left(\frac{\partial A_H}{\partial t}\right) $$

Where:

- \\( \small A_H \\) is an operator/observable (e.g. position, momentum, etc.) in the Heisenberg picture,
- \\( \small H \\) is the Hamiltonian of the system,
- \\( \small \hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \\( \small [·,·] \\) denotes the [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator)


## No Time Dependence

If the operator \\( \small A_H \\) does not have an explicit time dependence, the equation simplifies to:

$$ {i\hbar}{d \over d t}A_H = [A_H, H]. $$
