$$ \frac{F}{A} = E\frac{\Delta L}{L} $$

Where
* \\(F\\) is the force applied to the material,
* \\(A\\) is the area of the material where force is applied,
* \\(E\\) is the modulus of elasticity (a.ka. Young's modulus) of the material,
* \\(\Delta L\\) is the change in length of the material, and
* \\(L\\) is the original length of the material.

This version of Hooke's Law is generalized from the [original version](/formulas/hookes-law-springs) used to describe the force of springs.
