The following equations assume ideal, parallel-plate capacitors.

## Charge
The relationship between the voltage across a capacitor and the charge stored on each conductor is given by:

$$ V = \frac{Q}{C} $$

Where

- \\( \small V \\) represents the voltage across the capacitor,
- \\( \small Q \\) represents the charge stored on the capacitor, and
- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor, usually measured in farads (F).

## Capacitance

The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by:

$$ C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} $$

Where

- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \\( \small \epsilon \\) is the permittivity of the dielectric between the plates,
- \\( \small A \\) is the area of the plates, and
- \\( \small d \\) is the distance between the plates.


## Current

The current through a capacitor is given by:

$$ I = C \frac{dV}{dt} $$

Where

- \\( \small I \\) represents the current through the capacitor,
- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor, and
- \\( \small \frac{dV}{dt} \\) is the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor with respect to time.

## Energy

The energy stored in a capacitor is given by:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 $$

Where

- \\( \small E \\) represents the energy stored in the capacitor,
- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor, and
- \\( \small V \\) represents the voltage across the capacitor.
