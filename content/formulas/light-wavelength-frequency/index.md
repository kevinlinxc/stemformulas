The relationship between the wavelength and frequency of light in a vacuum is:

$$ c_0 = \lambda f $$

Where

* \\(\scriptsize \lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light,
* \\(\scriptsize  c_0\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and
* \\(\scriptsize  f\\) is the frequency of the light.

For a medium with a refractive index of \\(\scriptsize n\\), the relationship is:

$$ \frac{c_0}{n} = \frac{\lambda}{n} f $$

That is to say, the speed of light and wavelength change in a medium, but the frequency remains the same.
