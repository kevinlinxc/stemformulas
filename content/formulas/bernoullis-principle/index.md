The formula for Bernoulli's Principle (also known as Bernoulli's Equation) states that for two points along the streamline of an incompressible, inviscid, steady-flow fluid, the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy per unit volume, and potential energy per unit volume remains constant:

## Pressure Form

$$ P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 + \rho g h_1 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 + \rho g h_2 $$

Where

* \\( \small  \small P_1  \\) and \\( \small  \small P_2  \\) are the pressures at points 1 and 2,
* \\( \small  \small \rho  \\) is the density of the fluid,
* \\( \small  \small v_1  \\) and \\( \small  \small v_2  \\) are the velocities at points 1 and 2,
* \\( \small  \small g  \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and
* \\( \small  \small h_1  \\) and \\( \small  \small h_2  \\) are the heights at points 1 and 2.

It can be also be written by stating that the sum of the quantities remain constant:

$$ P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g h = const $$


## Energy Form

$$ \frac{P_1}{\rho} + \frac{1}{2} v_1^2 + g h_1 = \frac{P_2}{\rho} + \frac{1}{2} v_2^2 + g h_2 $$

## Head Form

$$ \frac{P_1}{\gamma} + \frac{v_1^2}{2g} + h_1 = \frac{P_2}{\gamma} + \frac{v_2^2}{2g} + h_2 $$

Where 

* \\( \small  \small \gamma  \\) is the [specific weight](/formulas/specific-weight/) of the fluid.
