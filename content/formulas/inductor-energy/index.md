## Energy
The energy stored in an inductor is given by:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 $$

Where

- \\( \small E \\) represents the energy stored in the inductor in joules (J),
- \\( \small L \\) is the inductance of the inductor, in henries (H), and
- \\( \small I \\) is the current through the inductor, in amperes (A).
