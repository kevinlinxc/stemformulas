The energy stored in a capacitor is given by:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 $$

Where

- \\( \small E \\) represents the energy stored in the capacitor, measured in joules (J),
- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor, measured in farads (F), and
- \\( \small V \\) represents the voltage across the capacitor, in volts (V).
