The current through a capacitor is given by:

$$ I = C \frac{dV}{dt} $$

Where

- \\( \small I \\) is the current through the capacitor in amperes (A),
- \\( \small C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor in farads (F), and
- \\( \small \frac{dV}{dt} \\) is the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor with respect to time (V/s).
