Kinematic viscosity is the ratio of the viscosity (dynamic viscosity) to the density of a fluid:

$$ \nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho} $$

Where:

- \\\( \small \nu\ \\) is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid,
- \\\( \small \mu\ \\) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and
- \\\( \small \rho\ \\) is the density of the fluid.
