The formula for the period of a spring in simple harmonic motion is:

$$ T_s = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} $$

Where

* \\(\small T_s\\) is the period of oscillation,
* \\(\small m\\) is the mass attached to the spring, and
* \\(\small k\\) is the spring constant of the spring.

The frequency of oscillation is the reciprocal of the period:

$$ f_s = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} $$

Where

* \\(\small f_s\\) is the frequency of oscillation.
