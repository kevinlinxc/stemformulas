## Finite Geometric Series
For a series of the form \\( \small a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \ldots\\), the sum of the first \\(\small n\\) terms is

$$S_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} ar^i = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$

where \\(\small r >0, \neq 1 \\) is the common ratio. Note that this expression can be used for \\(\small r > 1\\)  unlike the infinite series formula below.

If \\(\small r = 1\\), then \\(\small S_n = an\\).

## Infinite Geometric Series
If \\(\small r\\) satisfies \\(\small  0 < r < 1\\), the sum of the infinite series is

$$S_{\infty} = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} ar^i = \frac{a}{1-r}$$
