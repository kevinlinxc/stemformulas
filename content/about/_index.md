Stemformulas is a website dedicated to providing a single place to look for STEM formulas. We made it
because we felt frustrated scrolling through websites and Google Images looking for formulas that are basically known truths. We hope you find this site useful!


## Tech Stack
This site is made with the static website framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), with many HTML/CSS/JS additions from our team.

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), deployed conveniently with GitHub Actions.

## Contributing
If you want to add a formula to this site, there are two ways you can do so. The first way is easier for you and more work for us, and the second way is the opposite:

1. Submit all the relevant information about the formula to our [Google Form](https://forms.gle/zXGeNJ4pRJG2Rh7L6) (can also be filled out on our [suggest](/suggest) page).

2. Create a pull request on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/kevinlinxc/stemformulas.com). More detailed instructions can be found on the site's README.

## Reporting an issue
If you think you've found a mistake in one of the formula pages or if you otherwise have some suggestions, please make a GitHub account and submit an issue [here](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io/issues/new).
