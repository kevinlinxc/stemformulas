Stemformulas is a website dedicated to providing a single place to look for STEM formulas. 

It was made by a few engineering students who were frustrated with the current state of formula searching online:
[Kevin Lin](https://kevinlinxc.com/) and [Pranjal Biswas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranjalbiswas/), both based in Vancouver, Canada.

## Features
- The search bar is in focus on site load, so you can search for a formula quickly
- LaTeX can be copied by just clicking on it on any formula's page
- The / key can be used to open the search on any page
- The site has open-graph tags, so when you share a link to a formula on social media, it will show an image of the formula
- The site is mobile-friendly, so you can use it on your phone or tablet


## Tech Stack
This site is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io).

It is made with the static website framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), with many custom HTML/CSS/JS additions from our team.

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), deployed conveniently with GitHub Actions.
