Stemformulas is a website dedicated to providing a single place to look for STEM formulas. It has a long way to go to become that, but the foundation is laid out.

It was made by a few engineering students (lead by [@linguinelabs](https://x.com/linguinelabs)) who were frustrated with the current state of formula searching online. This frustration lead to the focus of the features of the site, which include:

- The search bar being in focus on site load, so you can search for a formula quickly
- LaTeX being copyable by just clicking on it on any formula's page
- The / key being used to open the search on any page
- Formula pages having nice preview images when shared on social media, so people don't even need to visit the site to see the formula
- The mobile-friendliness of the site


## Tech Stack
This site is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io).

It is made with the static website framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), with many custom HTML/CSS/JS additions from our team.

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), deployed conveniently with GitHub Actions.

## Contributing
If you want to add a formula to this site, there are two ways you can do so.

1. Submit a formula on our [suggest](/suggest) page). This has been revamped to have a preview for ease of use.

2. Create a pull request directly on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io). This is of course easier for us to merge, but requires more effort from you. 
More detailed contribution instructions can be found in the [README](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-formula).
