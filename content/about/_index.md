Stemformulas is a website dedicated to providing a single place to look for STEM formulas. I made it
because I felt frustrated scrolling through website and Google Images looking for formulas that are basically
set in stone. I felt like we could do better than this in the 21st century, and so, I did.


## Tech Stack
This site is made with the static website framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo),
with modifications from me of course.

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), deployed conveniently with GitHub actions.

## Contributing
If you want to add a formula to this site, please create a pull request on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/kevinlinxc/stemformulas.com), copying the existing
format in /content/formulas/. If you want to add a formula but don't know how to use GitHub,
this is a great opportunity to get your feet wet.
