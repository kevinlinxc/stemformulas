Stemformulas is a website dedicated to providing a single place to look for STEM formulas. 

It was made by a few engineering students who were frustrated with the current state of formula searching online:
[Kevin Lin](https://kevinlinxc.com/) and [Pranjal Biswas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranjalbiswas/), both based in Vancouver, Canada.

We hope you find this site useful!


## Tech Stack
This site is made with the static website framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), with many HTML/CSS/JS additions from our team.

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), deployed conveniently with GitHub Actions.

## Contributing
If you want to add a formula to this site, there are two ways you can do so. The first way is easier for you and more work for us, and the second way is the opposite:

1. Submit a suggestion for a formula on our [Google Form](https://forms.gle/EWjwFmiEQrrjsZEF9) (can also be filled out on our [suggest](/suggest) page).

2. Create a pull request on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/kevinlinxc/stemformulas.com). More detailed instructions can be found in the [README](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io#readme).
