# stemformulas
Welcome to [https://stemformulas.com/](https://stemformulas.com/), the best place in the world to look for STEM-related
formulas.

## Contributing formulas:

There are three ways contribute formulas, in order of most to least technical (i.e. least to most work for us):

1. Develop code in your own branch and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io/pulls) with the new formula
2. Create an [issue](https://github.com/stemformulas/stemformulas.github.io/issues) with all the necessary information
for the formula, and a maintainer will do step 1 for you
3. Fill out this Google Form with all the necessary information for the formula:
